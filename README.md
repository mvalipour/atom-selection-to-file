# selection-to-file package

> Quickly create a file from active text selection.

This is currently build with the following assumptions:

- generated file will have snake casing. (well, I write mainly ruby these days)


### TODO:

- Cleanup hacky code
- Write tests
- Support various casing styles
- Support a "prompt" mode where a "create file" prompt is shown -- to allow user to modify the path
